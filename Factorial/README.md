# factorial

A factorial function, often denoted by an exclamation point (n!), is a mathematical function that multiplies a given positive integer (n) by all the positive integers less than it. In simpler terms, the factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

For example:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

By definition:

0! = 1 (this is a special case).

Factorials are used in various areas of mathematics, including combinatorics (for counting permutations and combinations), algebra, and calculus.
